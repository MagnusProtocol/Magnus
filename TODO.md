# TODOs

The features to be implemented in the project are stored here and if you wanna contribute, just check this file out.

List:

- TLS Sockets (TCP and UDP)
- Encryption
  - ECDH wrapper
  - AES-512
- Compression
  - ZSTD
  - LZ4 (optional)

Order:

- Make the units (encryption, compression, sockets)
- Tie the units together (uniform, easily switchable, minimal overhead api)
- Implement the protocol (after finalising it)
