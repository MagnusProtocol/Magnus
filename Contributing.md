# Contributing

Some rules you MUST follow for your PR to be accepted:

- Must obey the code formatting (just run the format-all.sh file before comitting)
- Must uphold security standards (from the last version of Magnus, we have decided to focus more on security)
- Must obey project structure (use your brain and organise things properly)
- Must write tests for everything you implement
- Must write performant code, performance is everything after security (we are not electron)
- Must obey code structure

As a side note, check for logical issues like race conditions, memory leaks etc as well.
